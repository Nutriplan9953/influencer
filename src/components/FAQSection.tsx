      question: "Is InfluencerConnect Pro compliant with Instagram's terms of service?",
      answer: "Yes, absolutely. We use only public data and approved Instagram APIs. We don't scrape private information or violate any platform guidelines. Our methods are completely safe and compliant."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of email deliverability rates can I expect?",
      answer: "Our users typically see 85-95% email deliverability rates. We use advanced email verification and warming techniques to ensure your messages reach the inbox, not spam folders."
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from expensive competitors like AspireIQ?",
      answer: "While tools like AspireIQ cost $200-500/month and focus on macro-influencers, we specialize in micro-influencers (1K-100K followers) at a fraction of the cost. Our automation saves time while our micro-influencer focus delivers better ROI for small businesses."
    },
    {
      question: "Why focus on micro-influencers instead of bigger ones?",
      answer: "Micro-influencers have 3-7x higher engagement rates, more authentic relationships with followers, and cost 90% less than macro-influencers. For small businesses, they deliver much better ROI and conversion rates."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I export my data and contacts?",
      answer: "Yes! You can export all your contacts, campaign data, and analytics in CSV format. We believe in data portability and never lock you in."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer integrations with other tools?",
      answer: "We integrate with popular email platforms, CRM systems, and analytics tools. Our API allows custom integrations, and we're constantly adding new partnerships based on user requests."
